        <h1>Git</h1>
        <p>But <img src="VCS logos/Git-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="50px"> is the most popular in the market with over 80 million users and a very large community.</p>
        <h3>How Git works?</h3>
        <p>Unlike the other version controll systems (CVS, Subversion, Bazzar) which stores your data in a files, Git has its own mehtod to track your history. Actually Git uses snaps to keep track of your file, so the story of Git is that it take snap of your code (Just as you take snap when you think you are looking pretty) when you commit. So in reality Git is storing a <b>Stream of Snaps.</b> To maintain its efficieny Git is smart enough to refer to the previous snap if your new snap matches with the previous one.</p>
        <h3>Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory</h3>
        <p>If you have a project that is not under Version Controll System and now you want to put it under git, you first have to move to that Directory.</p>
        <img src="screen_shots/Capture00.PNG" alt="">
        <p>Now type:</p>
        <i>$ git init</i>
        <img src="/screen_shots/Capture001.PNG" alt="">
        <p>This will create a .git repository that will contain all the necessary repository files. At this point nothing is tracked in your project.</p>
        <h3>Git Status</h3>
        <p>You can use the git status command to know the status of your files in your git repository, you get the detail of all the commits and the tracked and untracked files.</p>
        <p><i>$ git status</i></p>
        <img src="/screen_shots/Capture002.PNG" alt="">
        <h3>Git Add</h3>
        <p>Git Add command is used to move all the files that you select to the stagging area to be comitted.</p>
        <p><i>$ git add file_name</i></p>
        <img src="/screen_shots/Capture003.PNG" alt="">
        <p>You can also add all the folders to the stagging area by using . after git add</p>
        <p><i>$ git add .</i></p>
        <img src="/screen_shots/Capture004.PNG" alt="">

        <h3>Git Commit</h3>
        <p>Git commit is used to move files from stagging area to repository, you can give a message and a description with every commit.</p>
        <p><i>$ git commit</i></p>
        <img src="/screen_shots/Capture005.PNG" alt="">
        <p>The commit is showing 4 files changed because we have used <i>git add .</i></p>
        <img src="/screen_shots/Capture006.PNG" alt="">

        <h3>Git log</h3>
        <p>Git log command is used to see the detail of all the commits that you've done. It shows the detail like the hash, owner name and email, and the data and time of commit.</p>
